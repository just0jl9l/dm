<p>If each
<sc_element sys_idtf  = "element_of_set">element</sc_element> of 
<sc_element sys_idtf  = "set">set</sc_element> A are also elements of a set B, but set B contain at least one element, not included in A, that is A &sube; B, and A≠B, then A is 
<sc_element sys_idtf  = "">proper subset</sc_element> B. A proper subset is written as A &sub; B, B &sup; A.  The difference between “subset” and “proper subset” is like the difference between “less than or equal to” and “less than” for numbers.
 Example:
	<ul>
		<li>Let T = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}</li>
		<li>If S = {1, 2, 3}, S is not equal to T, and S is a subset of T</li>
		<li>Then S  &sub;  T</li>
		<li>Let Q = {4, 5, 6}.  Q is neither a subset of T nor a proper subset of T</li>
	</ul>
</p>
