A<b>
<sc_element sys_idtf  = "nrel_cartesian_product">Cartesian product</sc_element></b> - is a 
<sc_element sys_idtf  = "set">set</sc_element>

	of all 
<sc_element sys_idtf  = "cortege">ordered</sc_element>
2-tuples where each “part” is from a given 
<sc_element sys_idtf  = "set">set</sc_element>
<br>Denoted by A x B, and uses parenthesis (not curly brackets)
<br>For example, 2-D Cartesian coordinates are the 
<sc_element sys_idtf  = "set">set</sc_element> of all ordered pairs Z x Z
<br>Recall Z is the 
<sc_element sys_idtf  = "set">set</sc_element> of all 
<sc_element sys_idtf  = "set">set</sc_element>
<br>This is all the possible coordinates in 2-D space
<br>Example: Given A = { a, b } and B = { 0, 1 }, what is their Cartiesian product ?
<br>C = A x B = { (a,0), (a,1), (b,0), (b,1) }
<br>
<br>Formal definition of a 
<sc_element sys_idtf  = "nrel_cartesian_product">Cartesian product</sc_element>:
<br>A x B = { (a, b) | a &isin; A &and; b &isin; B}
<li>All the possible grades in this class will be a 
<sc_element sys_idtf  = "nrel_cartesian_product">Cartesian product</sc_element> of the 
<sc_element sys_idtf  = "set">set</sc_element> S of all the students in this class and the set G of all possible grades
<li>Let S = { Alice, Bob, Chris } and G = { A, B, C }
<li>D = { (Alice, A), (Alice, B), (Alice, C), (Bob, A), (Bob, B), (Bob, C), (Chris, A), (Chris, B), (Chris, C) }
<li>The final grades will be a 
<sc_element sys_idtf  = "subset">subset</sc_element> of this: { (Alice, C), (Bob, B), (Chris, A) }
<br>Such a <sc_element sys_idtf  = "subset">subset</sc_element> of a 
<sc_element sys_idtf  = "nrel_cartesian_product">Cartesian product</sc_element> is called a relation (more on this later in the course)
